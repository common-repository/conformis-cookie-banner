The banner automatically uses the font and colors of the theme you are using to give a seamless experience.
If you wish to adapt the banner even further (and know your way around CSS) you are welcome to adapt the styling of the banner at conformis/css/main.css in your wordpress plugin directory or by adapting and building the plugin yourself from source.
